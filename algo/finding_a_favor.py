# Finding a Favor v2 
#
# Each edge (u,v) in a social network has a weight p(u,v) that
# represents the probability that u would do a favor for v if asked.
# Note that p(v,u) != p(u,v), in general.
#
# Write a function that finds the right sequence of friends to maximize
# the probability that v1 will do a favor for v2.
# 

#
# Provided are two standard versions of dijkstra's algorithm that were
# discussed in class. One uses a list and another uses a heap.
#
# You should manipulate the input graph, G, so that it works using
# the given implementations.  Based on G, you should decide which
# version (heap or list) you should use.
#

# code for heap can be found in the instructors comments below
