# Infinite Mind Reading
#
# Just as a context-free grammar may be 'empty', it may also have an
# infinite language. We say that the language for a grammar is infinite if
# the grammar accepts an infinite number of different strings (each of
# which is of finite length). Most interesting (and creative!) languages
# are infinite.
# 
# For example, the language of this grammar is infinite:
#
# grammar1 = [ 
#       ("S", [ "S", "a" ] ),        # S -> S a
#       ("S", [ "b", ]) ,            # S -> b 
#       ] 
#
# Because it accepts the strings b, ba, baa, baaa, baaaa, etc. 
#
# However, this similar grammar does _not_ have an infinite language: 
#
# grammar2 = [ 
#       ("S", [ "S", ]),             # S -> S 
#       ("S", [ "b", ]) ,            # S -> b 
#       ] 
#
# Because it only accepts one string: b. 
#
# For this problem you will write a procedure cfginfinite(grammar)
# that returns True (the value True, not the string "True") if the grammar
# accepts an infinite number of strings (starting from any symbol). Your
# procedure should return False otherwise. 
#
# Consider this example: 
# 
# grammar3 = [ 
#       ("S", [ "Q", ] ),        # S -> Q
#       ("Q", [ "b", ]) ,        # Q -> b
#       ("Q", [ "R", "a" ]),     # Q -> R a 
#       ("R", [ "Q"]),           # R -> Q
#       ] 
#
# The language of this grammar is infinite (b, ba, baa, etc.) because it is
# possible to "loop" or "travel" from Q back to Q, picking up an "a" each
# time. Since we can travel around the loop as often as we like, we can
# generate infinite strings. By contrast, in grammar2 it is possible to
# travel from S to S, but we do not pick up any symbols by doing so. 
#
# Important Assumption: For this problem, you may assume that for every
# non-terminal in the grammar, that non-terminal derives at least one
# non-empty finite string.  (You could just call cfgempty() from before to
# determine this, so we'll assume it.)  
#
# Hint 1: Determine if "Q" can be re-written to "x Q y", where either x
# or y is non-empty. 
#
# Hint 2: The "Important Assumption" above is more important than it looks:
# it means that any rewrite rule "bigger" than ("P", ["Q"]) adds at least
# one token. 
#
# Hint 3: While cfginfinite(grammar) is not recursive, you may want to
# write a helper procedure (that determines if Q can be re-written to "x Q
# y" with |x+y| > 0 ) that _is_ recursive. Watch out for infinite loops:
# keep track of what you have already visited.
